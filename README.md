1. Content of this document is licenced under the conditions listed below or contained within it, are legally, illegally, in any other form possible or conceivable by anyone, anywhere or anything at anytime, completely and utterly, permanently and without any requirement for notification of any kind, BINDING, in every context possible, except physical, unless it is printed or transferred on some form of material capable of physically binding properties and applied to something or someone in a manner that would restrict movement, which is not a permissable use of the content and thus forbidden.

2. The BINDING nature of this licence, document, and content is effective immediately upon it being created, inclusive of everyone and everything, born or unborn, dead or otherwise so disposed of any condition known or unknown anywhere now and forever, eternally in any universe known or unknown, as stated multiple times within the document contents to avoid any confusion as to the nature of the binding this document is capable of producing as declared herein as a binding agent within the context of binding:

3.   By reading this document, or not reading this document, acknowledging it exists or not acknowleging it exists, you agree without needing to actually agree, to be bound by the BINDING terms it contains, forever, along with the other related conditions of BINDING described at multiple points within the document contents.

      (a) exclusion to this binding term is only possible if you stop reading this document NOW, but all other terms apply as written and in complete agreement with eachother, indefinitely and since you got this far, why stop reading now anyway?.

4.   This Document and contents are about me, not you, making the original document mine exclusively, unless:
      
      (a) I decide to make it about you, which would be contrary to it being about me and thus require it to become about me again, and not about you.
      (b) You decide to make it about you, which is unlikely to occur but not impossible or inconceivable, at which point the BINDING nature of the document and contents related to the contents or referred to by content similar to this content would remain in effect, thus making it about me again and only a vague referrence to something similar to you in a way or context that is really about me, as described in the next description to some degree.

5.   Some contents may appear to be about you, remind you of yourself, be similar to things about you, reflect you in some way.  In no possible interpretation in any context does that mean they are about you, except under the conditions described in item 10(a-(random-letter-of-the-alpabet)) 

6.   I declare to all public or private entities, for the record of any record, or recording for the sake of a record existing, this document is exclusively about me, unless it is about you, which it is not, so it is about me as has been declared herein, multiple times as to avoid any misinterpretation of the document or contents related to or about the content of this or any revision of the document or its contents as stated herein, multiple times in multiple ways to ensure the clarity and relationship between the contents and all other content included within the context of the document as it exists at any moment, in any form whatsoever, now and forever, previously and prior, eternally and always as stated herein multiple times in multiple ways, exclusive of ways that could be misinterpreted in any way conceivable or otherwise, as stated herein multiple times.

7.   Any interpretation of this document that is not about me exclusively is null and void, must be considered unsupportable in any legal context in any country on this planet or any other planet in any universe known or unknown as of the time of the commit to GitHub, including the periods of forever before and thereafter, eternally which is BINDING to everything and everyone, always, eternally unless it would imply in some way or way of being that it is not about me in some conceivable or indirect way of conceiving something that could be misinterpreted as not being about me exclusively, being bound as such to the notion of being bound by something that is able to bind without possessing physically binding properties, which is forbidden in the context of this document and any interpretation made regarding the content or context of the document or content related to the document contents.

8.  Any issues that could be cause for legal action, including but not limited to seeking compensation for damages, actual or perceived financial loss or any other legal action of any kind, percieved or real, believed to be a direct or indirect result of the document contents is actually in reality exclusively a perception of anyone other than myself and thus not real, making them not admissable, allowable, presentable as factual evidence in a court of law by anyone but myself and forbidden under the terms of this licence to be used in any legal context but in defense of me or the document contents in any context under the same conditions as the previous conditions of the licence.

      (a) Reserved for future use because the future should be useful when reserved.

9. Reserved for past use, because the past has a way of reminding me about why I created this licence and document content which escapes me at this moment and is best left in the past.

10. There is only one instance covered by the licence which would allow this document to be about you. 
    
      (a) You decide to make a copy of this document for personal or public use, at which time the contents would become yours in the context of the copied copy
       
      (b) Should that occur, the following terms become realized and in effect with full force and without possibility of becoming unbinding to you, but not to me.
          
          (i) You are allowed ot take the role of being "the me" in the context of this document but forbidden to be the real me, a copy of me, clone of me, or any other possible or impossible version of me, which is my exclusive right bound to me and not transferrable under any circumstances, ever unless I decide that such an option should be made available.
          
          (ii) You are granted the full right to modify your copy of this licence and document under the condition that you do not reveal the source of this licence, document and content to anyone other than me for as long as time is something or nothing and for the duration before and after you are acting in the role of "the me".
          
          (iii) At no time may a modification you make to your copy of this licence and document cause it to be about me directly in any way and/or in any legal context in any country on this planet or any other planet in any universe known or unknown as of the time of your edits including the periods of forever before and thereafter, eternally which is BINDING to everything and everyone, always, eternally unless it would imply in some way or way of being that it is about me in some conceivable or indirect way of conceiving something that could be misinterpreted as being about me exclusively, being bound as such to the notion of being bound by something that is able to bind without possessing physically binding properties, which is forbidden in the context of this document and any interpretation made regarding the content or context of the document or content related to the document contents.
          
          (iiii) You live your life as "the me" in a way that is enjoyable to you or brings joy or happiness to anyone you care about, especially if love is involved in some manner or the expression of love toward another without bringing harm to anyone in any way something could be of benefit to one person and be harmful to another without their express consent that they desire to be harmed by your love, thus negating the harmful effects your love would have otherwise produced as these things would please me greatly, and thus allowing it to be about the non "the me" in a way that is beneficial to both me and "the me" inclusive of the people you share your love with and care about.
          
          (iiiii) You treat others with respect and dignity when interacting with them in any way interactions are possible to occur and seek to ensure they understand that they are being treated that way because that is an excellent way to treat others, through your actions and context, without words, which would please me, making it about me while it is about you.
          
          (iiiiii) You protect and defend humanity when you become aware of anything that is detrimental to humanity. That defense should be carried out from a solution-oriented perspective seeking to understand the source of the detrimental influence and/or attack so you may develop strategies and actions which are based on understanding and knowledge.
          
          (iiiiiii)  You defend and protect children in the same manner but with an intense and powerful context that ensures children are being protected by the best you you are capable of being. This means you must act intelligently and responsibly in every aspect of such defense that your actions would not become harmful to the children you defend in the course of defending them. 
          
          (iiiiiiii) Should anyone tell you that you can't change the world, know they are wrong because they were sleeping in history class, don't see the world changing around them through  or believe THEY can't change the world. Fortunately, THEY are not YOU and they could never be me or you with such a belief about themselves.
          
          (iiiiiiiii) Know you are uniquely capable of facing the challenges you encounter. Challenges may appear to be impossible to overcome and attempts to overcome them may appear to be failures, but they are really valuable lessons "disguised" as failures which can provide crucial insight into how you may overcome them as you continue to face them. Continue to face them because they will continue to face you.
          
          (iiiiiiiiii) Have fun, because fun is worth having. 
          
          (iiiiiiiiiii)  Have fun to the benefit of others, not at their expense.
          
          (iiiiiiiiiiii) Express gratitude for any form of help, assistance, guidance, direction or other means of support you receive in a way that demonstrates sincerity
          
          (iiiiiiiiiiiii) Get to know who you are and use knowledge gained through that process to assist your journey to become who you want to be
          
          (iiiiiiiiiiiiii) Find creative ways to include others in your success so they may perceive your success as theirs as well.
         
11. The terms of section 10 are not exclusive and adding things which produce positive results for everyone to the list is encouraged. 

12. Any other term not expressed in this licence that could be of benefit to you and me and everyone else in both the short term and Long term is expressly implied under the condition that it is beneficial to you and others and me inclusively.
